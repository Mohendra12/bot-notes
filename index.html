  <p>This is an updated version so i think i can write here anything that i want to so let's write about India, so India is my country and i love my country, and i am proud to be an Indian, so are you proud as me. India is the most populated country in the world it's is rich in all the aspects and i am really proud to be an indian. So with this few word's i would like to conclude my speech no i think i need to write something more about India so being an Indian its a proud feeling. India has a rich cultural and heritage diversity and it is also known as the most diverse country in the world. India has 26 state's with 7 Union Territories. And i belong to Assam. Assam is a beautiful state that reside in the northeasthern state. There are seven sister's in the northeasthern state of India. So I love My India and I am proud to be an Indian. Thank you!</p>
